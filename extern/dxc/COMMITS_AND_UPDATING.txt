The active commit hash is set in the CMakeLists.txt in this folder

How to update DXC:

From a release:
1. Download the relase .zip and linux tarball
2. Create a new folder here, named after the commit hash
3. Create subfolders bin/, lib/, lib_linux/, and include/dxc/
4. Win32: Copy dxcompiler.dll and dxil.dll to bin/, then copy dxcompiler.lib to lib/
5. Linux: Copy libdxcompiler.so to lib_linux/
6. Copy the includes to include/dxc/
7. Set the new commit hash as active in CMakeLists.txt

From source:
1. clone https://github.com/jkunstwald/dxc-cmake and check out the desired commit in the DXC submodule
2. compile using "Minimum Size Release" on windows (if this fails, you're most likely missing the Windows WDK for your current Win10 SDK version)
3. do the same on linux - note: the binary will link to CRT symbols depending on the installed libc6 version (if this fails, try clang 9)
4. create a new folder here, named after the commit hash
5. create subfolders bin/, lib/, lib_linux/, and include/dxc/
6. (win32) copy dxcompiler.dll: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/bin/dxcompiler.dll to bin/dxcompiler.dll
7. (win32) copy dxcompiler.lib: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/lib/dxcompiler.lib to lib/dxcompiler.lib
8. (linux) copy libdxcompiler.so.3.7: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/lib/libdxcompiler.so.3.7 to lib_linux/libdxcompiler.so.3.7
9. copy the entire include folder: from DirectXShaderCompiler/include/dxc/ to include/dxc/
10. copy dxil.dll: this depends on the windows SDK version, if in doubt, copy the one of the previously active commit (bin/dxil.dll)
11. set the new commit hash as active in CMakeLists.txt
