Commit hashes are from the DXC github repository, find them using URLs like
https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXShaderCompiler/commit/7a8c4a20da905a736637595fc6111c3ce033ba21

The active commit hash is set in the CMakeLists.txt in this folder

How to update DXC:

1. clone https://github.com/jkunstwald/dxc-cmake and check out the desired commit in the DXC submodule
2. compile using "Minimum Size Release" on windows (if this fails, you're most likely missing the Windows WDK for your current Win10 SDK version)
3. do the same on linux - note: the binary will link to CRT symbols depending on the installed libc6 version (if this fails, try clang 9)
4. create a new folder here, named after the commit hash
5. create subfolders bin/, lib/, lib_linux/, and include/dxc/
6. (win32) copy dxcompiler.dll: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/bin/dxcompiler.dll to bin/dxcompiler.dll
7. (win32) copy dxcompiler.lib: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/lib/dxcompiler.lib to lib/dxcompiler.lib
8. (linux) copy libdxcompiler.so.3.7: from build/MinSizeRel/extern/DirectXShaderCompiler/lib/libdxcompiler.so.3.7 to lib_linux/libdxcompiler.so.3.7
9. copy the entire include folder: from DirectXShaderCompiler/include/dxc/ to include/dxc/
10. copy dxil.dll: this depends on the windows SDK version, if in doubt, copy the one of the previously active commit (bin/dxil.dll)
11. set the new commit hash as active in CMakeLists.txt
